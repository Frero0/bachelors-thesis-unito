\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those who have accompanied me on this academic journey.  
First and foremost, I wish to thank the entire examination committee and all the professors I have had the privilege to learn from during these years at the University of Turin.  
Their guidance, dedication, and passion for teaching have been an invaluable source of inspiration and growth.
A special and sincere thank you goes to \textbf{Professor Robert René Maria Birke}, who entrusted me with this project and guided me with patience and confidence.  
His insightful advice and availability were fundamental in transforming this thesis from an idea into a concrete and meaningful piece of work.  
I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to work on a topic so close to the frontier of research.
My heartfelt thanks also go to my family, for their unconditional support, for believing in me in every step of the way, and for reminding me of the importance of perseverance and balance.  
To my friends and colleagues, thank you for your encouragement, for the discussions that often turned into new ideas, and for making these university years a journey to remember.
Finally, to all those who in one way or another have contributed to this experience — with a piece of advice, a gesture, or simply their presence — I dedicate my most sincere thanks.
