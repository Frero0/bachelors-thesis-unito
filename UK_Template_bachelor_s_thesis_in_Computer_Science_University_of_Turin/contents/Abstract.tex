Time series are a fundamental component in numerous fields of application. Their analysis requires methodologies capable of handling large volumes of data, preserving temporal accuracy, and efficiently managing problems such as missing values and high variability. Traditional techniques, based on statistical models or classic \textit{forecasting} methods, are often limited when it comes to generating plausible synthetic data, reconstructing missing portions, or simulating alternative scenarios in a manner consistent with the multivariate and seasonal structures of the data. \textit{Diffusion Models} have become one of the most promising methodologies for generating sequential data, as they are capable of processing complex distributions and generating reliable samples. Among these, WaveStitch represents an innovative approach that combines arbitrary conditioning, parallelized generation, and cyclic representation of temporal characteristics, in order to better manage the tasks of imputation, forecasting, and simulation of time series. The results obtained have confirmed the potential of this model as a flexible and efficient tool in contexts characterized by the presence of time series, making it ideal for new research perspectives, but also for practical applications in critical, fragile, or sensitive situations, where reliable synthetic data is essential.
